A matrix is a rectangular table of values divided into rows and columns. An mÃ—n matrix has m rows and n columns.
Given a matrix A, we write Ai,j to indicate the value found at the intersection of row i and column j.

Say that we have a collection of DNA strings, all having the same length n . Their profile matrix is a 4Ã—n matrix P
in which P1,j represents the number of times that 'A' occurs in the jth position of one of the strings, P2,
j represents the number of times that C occurs in the jth position, and so on (see below).

A consensus string c is a string of length n formed from our collection by taking the most common symbol at each
position; the jth symbol of c therefore corresponds to the symbol having the maximum value in the j-th column of the
profile matrix. Of course, there may be more than one most common symbol, leading to multiple possible consensus
strings.
